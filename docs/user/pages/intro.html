_Introduction_

# Welcome
[PotOfCoffee2Go][]'s Encrypted Steganography System is web based with a local server backend using the browser as the frontend. The text to be embedded into a chosen image is pasted into a text box. Text can be plain, [Markdown][], or HTML. The encryption passphase (sometimes called 'secret key' or 'password') is entered which both the sender and all recipients must know in order to decode the message.

As there are many differing encryption applications available for various operating systems, no attempt is made to dictate encryption beyond the passphrase encryption  ([symmetric][]). An example of using [OpenPGP] to encrypt messages prior to embedding in an image can be found [here](#).
