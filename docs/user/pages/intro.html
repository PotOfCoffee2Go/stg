# Welcome
[PotOfCoffee2Go][]'s Encoded Steganography System is web based on a local server backend using the browser as the frontend. The text to be embedded into a chosen image is pasted into a text box. Text can be plain, [Markdown][], or HTML. The encoding passphase (sometimes called 'secret key' or 'password') is entered which both the sender and all
recipients must know in order to decode the message from the image. The system works similar to sending encrypted text in email, only using images instead.

::#definitions::
Since encryption can be confusing. will define a few words to that will be used in this documentation.

  * Message
    - Data to be embedded into an image.
  * Encode
    - Embed message into an image using a passphrase.
  * Decode
    - Extract message from an image using the same passphrase.
  * Encrypt
    - Message that has been encrypted using various protocols.
  * Decrypt
    - Message restored to original using same protocol.

Basic usage is to enter a passsphrase and choose an image file.  Press 'Decode' and the message will apear in the text box. Type/paste a message in the text box and press 'Encode' to embed the message.

Many differing encryption protocols and applications are available so no attempt is made to dictate which encryption protocol is to be used.

If the message has been encrypted using a protocol like [OpenPGP][], anyone knowing the passphrase can decode the message from the image, however, only the recipients for which it was encrypted be able to decrypt the message.

 An example of using [OpenPGP] to encrypt messages prior to embedding in an image can be found [here](#).
