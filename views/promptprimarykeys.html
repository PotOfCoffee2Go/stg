  <h3>Welcome to steganoserver!</h3>
  <p>Before you can start sending secret messages hidden in-plain-site images, a
  lockbox and your personal keys need to be built to prevent unwanted eyes from
  viewing your messages. Also, note that others need to install steganoserver in
  order to exchange messages with you.</p>

  <h4>Keys</h4>
 <div>
  <p><img style="height: 3em;width: auto;float:left;border-radius: 15px;margin-right:1em;" src="/assets/private_key.png">
  <img style="height: 3em;width: auto;float:right;border-radius: 15px;margin-left:1em;" src="/assets/public_key.png">
  There are two keys required to scramble (encrypt and decrypt) messages. The private
  (pink) key which only you have, and a public (blue) key which you exchange
  with friends. The private key is safely tucked away and you can pretty much
  ignore it - though you can view it if you wish.
  <br>On the other hand, you would send the image of the public key to your friends.
  Likewise, they send theirs to you. This can be done safely over unsecure networks,
  social media, cell, email, sneaker.net, etc.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Lockboxes</h4>
  <p><img style="height: 5em;width: auto;float:right; margin-left:1em;" src="/assets/chest-2884250_640.png">
  A lockbox contains a set of keys (a keyring), as well as the images in which that
  keyring was used to hide messages. You can create as many lockboxes as you want allowing
  differing groups of recipients.
  <br>To open a lockbox requires a phrase which
  is magically bound to the box. The phase can not be changed and the lockbox
  can not be opened without it. Both the sender and recipient(s) need to know
  the phrase to open the lockbox.
  <br>Note that even if one knows the lockbox phrase - each image in the box
  still requires proper keys to unscramble the messages contained within.</p>

  <h4>Keyrings</h4>
  <p><img style="height: 3em;width: auto;float:left;border-radius: 10px;margin-right:1em;" src="/assets/key-1242056_640.jpg"></p>
  <p>When an image contains someones public key you will be given the opportunity
  to place the key in any lockboxes that you wish. Thus the key will be added
  to each selected lockbox's keyring.
  <br>When you put a message (with image) in a lockbox, the message is scrambled,
  signed, and embedded into the image such that the resulting image can be sent
  safely; knowing that only the people on the keyring can unscramble it and only
  if they have your public key, and firstly know the phrase needed to unlock the box.</p>

  <h4>Signing</h4>
  <p>All messages are signed using the senders keys. This verifies who created
  the message and insures the message has not been altered.

  <h4>Lockbox phrase</h4>
  <p><img style="height: 3em;width: auto;float:left;border-radius: 10px;margin-right:1em;" src="/assets/chest-2536477_640.png">
  Each lockbox has a name which is added to scrambled images filenames.
  This helps recipients identify images containing messages. The first time
  an image in a lockbox is unscrambled the system will ask for the lockbox phrase.
  If is successsful then the phrase is encrypted and stored for future messages,
  <br>Each Lockbox has a special ability to send it's phrase to others without
  (obviouly) requiring it to be unlocked by the recipients. Only the creator
  can send it, and only to people currently on it's keyring.</p>

  <h3>Master passphrase</h3>
  <p>The master passphrase is the one that rules them all. This phrase is used

  <h3>Generate your public and private keys</h3>
  <p>So let's begin with a few questions needed to make your keys...</p>
  <div class="left-side box">
    <form name="genKeysForm" id="genKeysForm" action="/genkeys" method="post" encType="multipart/form-data">
    Name, nickname, handle, or identity so friends know it is you. Images will
    have this name included in their filename - so only letters, numbers, spaces,
    and underbars are allowed :(<br>
    <input type="text" id="keyname" name="keyname" form="genKeysForm" value="" />
    <br>Email, can be real or fake but needs to be formatted to look like a real one<br>
    <input type="text" id="keyemail" name="keyemail" form="genKeysForm" value="" />
    <br>Optional short description, quote, saying shown with your public key<br>
    <input type="text" name="keycomment" form="genKeysForm" value="" />
  </div>
  <div style="clear: both;"></div>
  <p>  <img style="height: 5em;width: auto;float:right; margin-left:1em;" src="/assets/chest-2884250_640.png">
  Almost done! Because your private key is so precious, it must be safely locked away
  in a lockbox with a few other dark secrets used to scramble your messages.
  To open the lockbox you will need to give a secret phrase.</p>
  <p><img style="height: 3em;width: auto;float:left;border-radius: 10px;margin-right:1em;" src="/assets/chest-2536477_640.png">
  Remember! The words
  are magically bound to the box when it is cast, so it can never-ever be re-opened
  if the phrase is forgotten. Your previous messages can not be unscrambled and you
  would have to start over with a brand new set of keys!</p>
  <p>Also, you will need your secret lockbox phrase to restart this steganography server!</p>
  <div class="left-side box">
    Enter secret phrase that opens the lockbox containing your private key. Any characters can
    be used but highly recommend just words of a phrase you will remember. The phrase
    you enter will not be known or shown again, so might wanna have a copy in a safe place.<br>
    <input type="text" name="keypassphrase" form="genKeysForm" value="{{{cfg.key.passphrase}}}" />
    <br>Excellent, press this button to create your keys.<br>
